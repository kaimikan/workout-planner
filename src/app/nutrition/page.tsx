        Not big into overthinking this. I value easy to make decently-healthy
        food like rice with a rice boiler, friend eggs, boiled chicken, peanut
        butter, oats with yoghurt with honey/fruits, bananas, kiwis, carrots,
        tomatoes.

        Processed foods I try to avoid but if it happens that I eat a chocolate
        bar or something else, like a casual block of cheese, I don't sweat it.
        Pro tip for those things - out of sight out of mind. If you can't see it
        it's much harder to get the initial craving for it, and once you start
        it, it kind of turns into a quest to complete it.
