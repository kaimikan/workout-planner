        Overthinking is a big no-no. Going in cycles in your mind without taking
        any action is plain stupid but also very human. Everyone is afraid.
        Afraid does not mean paralyzed in fear, you can act and still be afraid.

        Your mind is capable of creating monsters out of thin air. Realize that
        we are all so impermanent and that this is all so temporary. Do not let
        the bad overcome the good in the way you see the world, yourself or the
        past/present/future.

        Being realistic and not lying to yourself are both important. Despite
        that being positively delusional can actually transform your objectively
        bad situation into a good one. You have to believe in it at least a
        smidge in order to achieve it.
