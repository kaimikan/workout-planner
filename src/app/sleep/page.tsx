        Very very very important for everything - recovery of body, absorption
        of information, recovery of energy and clarity of mind. Try to work with
        the natural day/night cycle. If you can get sunlight to wake you up,
        it's ultra epic.

        The start of your day often sets the tone for everything else. Quiet,
        almost meditative waking up and stretching/strolling sets you on a good
        path.
