# Interactive Fitness Planner & Tracker

### Project Overview and Planned Development Below

## Objective

Develop a responsive web application that allows users to plan, track, and visualize their fitness goals and activities.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication

- Login and registration system (email and password).
- Option to log in via **Google** or **GitHub** OAuth.

### 2. Dashboard

- Displays an overview of fitness metrics such as calories burned, weekly progress, and upcoming workout plans.
- Includes customizable widgets.

### 3. Workout Planner

- **Interactive drag-and-drop calendar** to plan weekly workouts.
- Auto-suggestions for exercises based on user-selected goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle building).

### 4. Activity Tracker

- Track activities in real-time with a timer or manually input completed exercises.
- Integration with fitness APIs like **Fitbit** or **Apple Health** (optional for advanced implementation).

### 5. Progress Visualization

- Dynamic charts to visualize weight, BMI changes, or workout adherence using libraries like **Chart.js** or **D3.js**.
- Goals breakdown (e.g., "50% of weekly goal achieved").

### 6. Responsive Design

- Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
- Use a CSS framework like **TailwindCSS** or a custom design with CSS Grid and Flexbox.

### 7. Community Section

- A mini-forum or Q&A section where users can share tips or ask questions.
- Ability to upvote helpful posts.

## Bonus Features

- **Dark Mode Toggle:** Persistent across user sessions.
- **Gamification:** Badges and rewards for milestones like "Completed 10 workouts."
- **Data Export:** Allow users to export their fitness data as CSV or PDF.
- **PWA Compatibility:** Make the site installable as a Progressive Web App.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React or Vue.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js or Django
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth or Auth0
- **Deployment:** Deployed on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for frontend and AWS/GCP/Heroku for the backend.

## Expected Deliverables

1. Fully functional and deployed web application.
2. GitHub repository with a well-structured README (including setup instructions, features, and demo link).
3. Demo video or presentation showcasing the app's key features.

## Why This Stands Out in a Portfolio

- **Problem-Solving:** Shows ability to address real-world use cases (fitness tracking).
- **Technical Breadth:** Covers full-stack development, API integration, and responsive design.
- **UI/UX Skills:** Highlights design sense with user-friendly interfaces and visualizations.
- **Scalability:** Demonstrates knowledge of advanced topics like PWA and external integrations.

This project not only showcases essential web development skills but also adds a unique, interactive element that stands out to potential employers or clients.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
